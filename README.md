## Info
My first Take and Hold custom character, based off of Ricky Dicky Random. 
I've always lamented getting any of the parts from the modular gun mods because they're basically unusable in RDR. 
This character is an attempt to solve that issue. 

Everything else is exactly the same as RDR, except you get one extra token per wave on 5 hold mode. 
Let me know how it goes, whether anything needs to be changed, like some weapon groups or parts spawning too much.
